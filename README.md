## A lot of small useful scripts

This repo has been built over the years as the result of working on [vk.com community on AE expressions and scripts](http://vk.com/ae_exp).

The main purpose of the repository is education, so you are free to use these scripts in any way you see fit.
*Some of these scripts are unfinished or may work not as expected.*
